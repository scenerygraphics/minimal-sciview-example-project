# Minimal [sciview](https://github.com/scenerygraphics/sciview) example project ðŸš€

This repository template serves as a minimal example for a sciview-based project. Click **Use this template** above to create your own project based on this template. We include both Maven and Gradle project file examples â€“ but recommend to choose one of them.

## Running

This example project includes both Maven and Gradle project files, together with the wrappers for both Maven and Gradle. You can run the demo included as part of this template project right away from the command line using Maven via `./mvnw compile exec:java`, or using Gradle via `./gradlew run`. Alternatively, you can import either the Maven project in `pom.xml` or the Gradle project in `build.gradle.kts` as a project into the Java/Kotlin IDE of your liking. We recommend the free IDE [Jetbrains IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

## File Reference

* `pom.xml` This is the Maven project file that defines the project's name, version and GAV (group, artifact, version).
* `src/main/java/sc/iview/minimal/MyDemo.java` This is the implementation of the MyDemo plugin. Feel free to adjust to your liking.
